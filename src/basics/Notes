 for triangle pattern for ascending means increase with row num then
 then inner condition
here initialize j = 1
 j<=i

for triangle pattern for descending means decrease with row num then
then inner condition
here initialize j = i
j<=n

store character = char abc = 'A' and to check char At.index(0)

calculate power:
10^8
Math.pow(10,8)

check the variable is lower or uppercase

Character.isUpperCase

for increasing count row wise we can use counter vriable = i (outer loop variable) as we can every row start with row number
